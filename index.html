            <h3>Facility Location Siting</h3>
            <p>Imagining a city or firm needs to decide the locations of new bike-share dock stations (or perhaps cell phone towers). How can we site the system of stations such that as much as potential customers can be served (or some other similar metrics) given the limited budget we have? I have involved in several research projects that aim to mathematically formulate and solve such a problem</p>

            <h3>Transportation Modeling</h3>
            <p>Have you carpooled with other people in urban centers like Manhattan or Chicago downtown? Such urban centers often are characterized by one-way streets and small city blocks that may entail vehicle detours while picking up or dropping off travelers in a shared-ride service. How about reducing vehicle detours by enabling short-distance walkings in planning vehicle routes? I have involved several projects that aim to solve such a problem, either assuming demands known in advance (static) or demands revealed over time (dynamic)</p>
